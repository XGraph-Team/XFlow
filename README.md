**[XFlow Homepage](https://xflow.network)** | **[Documentation](https://xflow.network/docs)** | **[Paper Collection](https://github.com/aquastar/awesome-network-flow)** 

**XFlow** is a library built upon Python to easily write and train method for a wide range of applications related to graph flow problems. XFlow is organized task-wise, which provide datasets benchmarks, baselines and auxiliary implementation.

# Installation

```
pip install xflow-net
```

# Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N0gFLSOl1r4h0tvqzStssEZSnmNMvoHc?usp=sharing&pli=1#scrollTo=iXN5BYm4sh4T)

```python
import xflow

from xflow.dataset.nx import BA, connSW
from xflow.dataset.pyg import Cora
from xflow.diffusion import SI, IC, LT
from xflow.util import run

# graphs to test
fn = lambda: connSW(n=1000, beta=0.1)
fn.__name__ = 'connSW'
gs = [Cora, fn, BA]

# Diffusion models to test
df = [SI, IC, LT]

# Configurations of IM experiments
from xflow.method.im import pi as im_pi, degree as im_degree, sigma as im_sigma, celfpp as im_celfpp, greedy as im_greedy
me = [im_pi]
rt = run (
    graph = gs, diffusion = df,
    method = me, eval = 'im', epoch = 10, 
    budget = 10, 
    output = [ 'animation', 'csv', 'fig'])
```
