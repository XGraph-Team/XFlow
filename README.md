## Tasks

### Spreading Task 
Task, Data, and Baselines

- (max/min/understand/predict coverage, given diffusion process and starting nodes)
- important concept: ***Reverse Reachable Sets (RR set), K-core decomposition***
- IM and variants (node)
- simulation-based, proxy/heuristic based, sketch based
- Dynamic Influence Maximization, Competitive Influence Maximization
- competitive IM vs network interdiction
    - 2 or more competitors can remove/add edges or change nodes

    [](https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.044311)
    
    
### Backtracking Task
Task, Data, and Baselines

- (identify starting nodes, given diffusion process and coverage)
- If diffusion is not given
- Source Identification, or Identification of influential spreaders

### Diffusion learning

- Min-cost Max-Flow (edge), network simplex

### Explanability Task
Task, Data, and Baselines

### Multilayer

- percolation
- synchronization

Question: main-stream task of single and multilayer network has little overlap. So they can be extended to each other.

## Benchmarks

## Implemented Baselines
We list currently supported XFlow models, layers and operators according to category:

## Create your own models



### Manage experiments with GraphGym

GraphGym allows you to manage and launch GNN experiments, using a highly modularized pipeline (see [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/graphgym.html) for the accompanying tutorial).

```
git clone https://github.com/XFlow-team/pytorch_geometric.git
cd pytorch_geometric/graphgym
bash run_single.sh  # run a single GNN experiment (node/edge/graph-level)
bash run_batch.sh   # run a batch of GNN experiments, using differnt GNN designs/datasets/tasks
```

Users are highly encouraged to check out the [documentation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest), which contains additional tutorials on the essential functionalities of XFlow, including data handling, creation of datasets and a full list of implemented methods, transforms, and datasets.
For a quick start, check out our [examples](https://github.com/XFlow-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples) in `examples/`.


## Installation

XFlow is available for Python 3.7 to Python 3.10.

### Anaconda

You can now install XFlow via [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/XFlow/XFlow) for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations ðŸ¤—
If you have not yet installed PyTorch, install it via `conda` as described in the [official PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Given that you have PyTorch installed (`>=1.8.0`), simply run

```
conda install XFlow -c XFlow
```

### Pip Wheels

We alternatively provide pip wheels for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations, see [here](https://data.XFlow.org/whl).


For additional but optional functionality, run

```
pip install torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.XFlow.org/whl/torch-1.12.0+${CUDA}.html
```
