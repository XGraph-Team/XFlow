## Spreading Task 
Task, Data, and Baselines

- (max/min/understand/predict coverage, given diffusion process and starting nodes)
- important concept: ***Reverse Reachable Sets (RR set), K-core decomposition***
- IM and variants (node)
- simulation-based, proxy/heuristic based, sketch based
- Dynamic Influence Maximization, Competitive Influence Maximization
- competitive IM vs network interdiction
    - 2 or more competitors can remove/add edges or change nodes

## Backtracking Task
Task, Data, and Baselines

- (identify starting nodes, given diffusion process and coverage)
- If diffusion is not given
- Source Identification, or Identification of influential spreaders

## Diffusion learning

- Min-cost Max-Flow (edge), network simplex

## Explanability Task
Task, Data, and Baselines

**Multilayer**

- percolation
- synchronization

Question: main-stream task of single and multilayer network has little overlap. So they can be extended to each other.
