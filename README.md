Task, Data, and Baselines

## Spreading Task 
    - (max/min/understand/predict coverage, given diffusion process and starting nodes)
    - important concept: ***Reverse Reachable Sets (RR set), K-core decomposition***
    - IM and variants (node)
    - simulation-based, proxy/heuristic based, sketch based
    - Dynamic Influence Maximization, Competitive Influence Maximization
    - competitive IM vs network interdiction
        - 2 or more competitors can remove/add edges or change nodes

## Backtracking Task
    - (identify starting nodes, given diffusion process and coverage)
    - If diffusion is not given
    - Source Identification, or Identification of influential spreaders
- Diffusion learning
    - Min-cost Max-Flow (edge), network simplex

## Explanability Task

**Multilayer**

- percolation
- synchronization

Question: main-stream task of single and multilayer network has little overlap. So they can be extended to each other.
