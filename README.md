## Spreading Task 

selected variants

- (max/min/understand/predict coverage, given diffusion process and starting nodes)
- important concept: ***Reverse Reachable Sets (RR set), K-core decomposition***
- IM and variants (node)
- simulation-based, proxy/heuristic based, sketch based
- Dynamic Influence Maximization, Competitive Influence Maximization
- competitive IM vs network interdiction
    - 2 or more competitors can remove/add edges or change nodes

    [](https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.044311)
    
### Benchmarks

### Implemented Baselines

### Create your own models
    


## Backtracking Task

selected variants

- (identify starting nodes, given diffusion process and coverage)
- If diffusion is not given
- Source Identification, or Identification of influential spreaders

### Benchmarks

### Implemented Baselines

### Create your own models




## Diffusion learning

selected variants

- Min-cost Max-Flow (edge), network simplex

### Benchmarks

### Implemented Baselines

### Create your own models




## Explanability Task

Task, Data, and Baselines

### Benchmarks

### Implemented Baselines

### Create your own models




## Multilayer

- percolation
- synchronization

Question: main-stream task of single and multilayer network has little overlap. So they can be extended to each other.

### Benchmarks

### Implemented Baselines

### Create your own models




## Installation

XFlow is available for Python 3.7 to Python 3.10.

### Anaconda

You can now install XFlow via [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/XFlow/XFlow) for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations 🤗
If you have not yet installed PyTorch, install it via `conda` as described in the [official PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Given that you have PyTorch installed (`>=1.8.0`), simply run

```
conda install XFlow -c XFlow
```

### Pip Wheels

We alternatively provide pip wheels for all major OS/PyTorch/CUDA combinations, see [here](https://data.XFlow.org/whl).


For additional but optional functionality, run

```
pip install torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.XFlow.org/whl/torch-1.12.0+${CUDA}.html
```
