I think I have fixed the issue with the broken polygons by making a
separate polygons table and filtering them on validity. I've also made
a separate script to test on invalidity, which now lives in
util/invalid-polygons.sql.

To distinguish polygon-like open linestrings from linelike open
linestrings, I'm using the heuristic that the distance between the
start and enpoint of the line should be less than (or equal to) the
length of the line divided by two, which is actually quite liberal
since it includes two legs of equidistant triangles as polygons.

In all of EuropePower.osm, 11 polygons are invalid, and of those, just
1 actually creates a multipolygon when buffered. In other words, the
underlying data issue is probably common enough, but it rarely
generates an error. And in each of those cases, buffering the line
rather than the created polygon will create a proper polygon.

I can repeat the issue with the broken multipolygons.
I results from self-intersecting polygons.
Some of these, apparently, are actually... lines.

Which is of course because I originally hadn't specified that the damn
thing had to be stations. I've modified the query so it returns only stations.

And now, I just get two stations, which is just enough to fail :-).

Start of a new logfile to document GridKit development.

Applying GridKit's export to a network model, missing properties are a
large problem. Without knowing the line voltage and/or frequency, it
is impossible to determine the line impedance, and it is impossible to
determine if a station should need a transformer. Without knowning
that, results will be highly distorted.

It is my goal to produce a *consistent* and *complete* model of the
electricity network from OpenStreetMap data, given that 'perfect'
information will never be forthcoming. (Such is not in the nature of
'open' data systems). Thus, GridKit tries to *interpret* the given
data in the most *reasonable* way possible.

Part of that is developing and testing heuristics for discovering
topological relatiosn from spatial relations. Part of that is
resolving conflicts using a consensus heuristic. And I think the last
part that is statistical inference of missing values.

For stations, that is not very interesting, because a station must
carry at least those voltages of the lines it is attached
to. Typically these should be the same, but I can't check that! There
might be a transformer inbetween or the voltage may be
misattributed. For a line, however, it directly affects the
performance of the network. So it is on lines that I focus.

A line always has a few features that provide some information on it:

+ length
+ connected stations
+ neighboring lines

Furthermore, we are not actually very interested in the exact voltage
and frequency (at least not as reported by the user), but rather in
the 'classification' of the line, as a guide to its impedance
characteristics. A preliminary classification (based on observation of
data from Germany/Europe) might be as follows:

| Voltage \ Frequency | DC                  | 16.7/16.67Hz                | 50/60Hz                       |
|---------------------+---------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| <10kV               | Trams/Trolleys etc. | Minor railroads             | Endpoint Distribution         |
| 10-60kV             | -                   | Main Railroads              | Local distribution            |
| 60-120kV            | -                   | Railroad power Transmission | Low-voltage transmission      |
| 120-250kV           | HVDC                | -                           | Medium-voltage transmission   |
| 250-400kV           | HVDC                | -                           | High-voltage transmission     |
| >400kV              | HVDC                | -                           | Very-high-voltage transmision |

Traditionally, most interest has been in transmission and HVDC lines,
but there is no reason to focus on those exclusively.

I expect that lines in these different categories differ on the tree
features noted above, and that those features can be used to determine
the probability that a line belongs to a particular class. Once the
class is known, the values of frequency and voltage can be derived
from the modal values in the category.

That probably means that the 50Hz values should be in a different
category from 60Hz, lest we start mixing 50Hz and 60Hz lines if we
ever cover an area that has both. Which is interesting.

The basic theory so far is that I want to use Bayes rule for computing
the probability that a line is in a given category given it has
certain features, by determining the probablity that a line would have
those features if it were in that category. Or to put it mathematically:

\begin{equation}
P(C|F) = \frac{P(F|C) * P(C)}{P(F)}
\end{equation}

A crucial assumption is that all features $F_i$ in $F$ are
independent, and that the combined probability of $P(F) =
\prod{F_i}$. Since that is not true for each of the separate neighbors
(neighborship is symmetrical), the calculation of $P(N)$ must be
somewhat different, and I haven't fully worked that out yet.

The line length feature, well, that depends a bit on the distribution
of the line lengths.  Now I have some reason to believe that the
/logarithm/ of the line length is normally distributed, and I hope to
find that the mean of the logaritmic line length differs sufficiently
between groups. And if it does, we can use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function][Gauss' formula]] to compute
the probability of finding a line with that length per category:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \frac{e^{-(x-\mu)/2\sigma^2}}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}
\end{equation}

Both attached stations are probably sufficiently independent features
to be treated as such.


** MultiPolygon Bugs.

But first, a bugfix. Apparently on some inputs and on some versions of
PostgreSQL, the following query:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select power_id, hstore(w.tags)->'power',
       st_buffer(case when st_isclosed(wg.line) and st_numpoints(wg.line) > 3 then st_makepolygon(wg.line)
                      when st_numpoints(wg.line) = 3 and st_isclosed(wg.line) or st_numpoints(wg.line) = 2 then st_buffer(wg.line, 1)
                      else st_makepolygon(st_addpoint(wg.line, st_startpoint(wg.line))) end, :station_buffer)
  from source_objects o
  join planet_osm_ways w on w.id = o.osm_id
  join way_geometry wg on wg.way_id = o.osm_id
 where o.osm_type = 'w' and o.power_type = 's';â€‹
#+END_SRC

Will sometimes result in the third variable being a multipolygon!

What I need to do is figure out when this happens:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT way_id, line, st_buffer(st_makepolygon(st_addpoint(line, st_startpoint(line))), 100)
     FROM way_geometry
     JOIN source_objects on osm_id = way_id and osm_type = 'w'
     WHERE power_type = 's' AND NOT ST_IsClosed(line) AND ST_NumPoints(line) > 3
) line_buffers (osm_id, line_geom, buffer_geom)
WHERE ST_GeometryType(buffer_geom) = 'ST_MultiPolygon';
#+END_SRC

I've been unable to replicate this issue, unfortunately, but I will,
and I will fix it.
